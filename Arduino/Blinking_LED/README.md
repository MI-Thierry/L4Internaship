## Arduino Blinking LED Project

This project serves as the initial stepping stone for exploration of Arduino and embedded systems development.
It focuses on the fundamental building block of interaction: blinking an LED. 

**Project Goals:**

* Introduce Arduino development environment and hardware.
* Familiarize basic C/C++ programming concepts used in Arduino projects.
* Understand the concept of digital pins and their control (input/output).
* Utilize the `delay()` function to create timed behavior.


**Project Steps:**

1. **Hardware Setup:**  We will connect an LED and resistor to the Arduino board as shown in this diagram.![](https://github.com/MI-Thierry/L4Internaship/blob/main/Arduino/Blinking_LED/Blicking%20LED%20sketch.png)
2. **Code Development:**  Using the Arduino IDE, the intern will write a simple program that:
    * Defines a pin connected to the LED as an output.
    * Sets the LED pin to HIGH, turning on the LED.
    * Uses `delay()` to wait for a specific duration (e.g., 1 second).
    * Sets the LED pin to LOW, turning it off.
    * Repeats the on-off cycle continuously, creating a blinking effect.
3. **Testing and Observation:** Once uploaded to the Arduino board, the program should make the LED blink repeatedly. This allows the intern to observe the interaction between code and hardware.

**Learning Outcomes:**

Through this project, the intern will gain a foundational understanding of:

* Arduino hardware components and their functionalities.
* Basic C/C++ syntax and control flow structures used in Arduino programming.
* The concept of digital output and controlling LED brightness.
* Implementing timing delays within the program using `delay()`.

**Benefits for the Internship:**

This initial project provides a solid foundation for the intern to build upon in subsequent projects.
It establishes their comfort level with the development environment and prepares them for more complex tasks involving sensors, actuators, and communication protocols.
