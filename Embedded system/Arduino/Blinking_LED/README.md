## Arduino Blinking LED Project

This project serves as the initial stepping stone for exploration of Arduino and embedded systems development.
It focuses on the fundamental building block of interaction: blinking an LED. 

**Project Goals:**

* Introduce Arduino development environment and hardware.
* Familiarize basic C/C++ programming concepts used in Arduino projects.
* Understand the concept of digital pins and their control (input/output).
* Utilize the `delay()` function to create timed behavior.


**Project Steps:**

1. **Hardware Setup:**  We will connect an LED and resistor to the Arduino board as shown in this diagram.![](https://github.com/MI-Thierry/L4Internaship/blob/main/Arduino/Blinking_LED/Blicking%20LED%20sketch.png)
2. **Code Development:**  Using the Arduino IDE, we wrote write a simple program that:
    * Defines a pin connected to the LED as an output.
    * Sets the LED pin to HIGH, turning on the LED.
    * Uses `delay()` to wait for a specific duration (e.g., 1 second).
    * Sets the LED pin to LOW, turning it off.
    * Repeats the on-off cycle continuously, creating a blinking effect.
3. **Testing and Observation:** Once uploaded to the Arduino board, the program should make the LED blink repeatedly.
