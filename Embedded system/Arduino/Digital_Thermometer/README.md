## Arduino Temperature Monitor with I2C LCD Display

This project creates a simple yet informative temperature monitor using an Arduino Uno, a DHT11 sensor, and an I2C 16x2 LCD display.
The DHT11 sensor detects the surrounding air temperature, and the Arduino translates that data into a user-friendly display on the LCD screen.

**Components:**

* Arduino Uno
* DHT11 Sensor
* I2C 16x2 LCD Display
* Jumper wires
* Breadboard (optional)

**Functionality:**

1. The DHT11 sensor continuously measures the ambient temperature.
2. The Arduino communicates with the DHT11 sensor through a single data pin.
3. Using a specific library, the Arduino retrieves the temperature data from the sensor.
4. The retrieved temperature value is then formatted (including units, such as 째C or 째F) and displayed on the first line of the I2C LCD.
5. You can customize the display further to show additional information, like "Temperature: " before the value or a small icon representing hot or cold.

**Learning Objectives:**

* Understand the operation of DHT11 temperature sensors.
* Learn I2C communication protocol for LCD displays.
* Explore using libraries to simplify sensor communication with Arduino.
* Practice data formatting and displaying information on an LCD screen.

**Applications:**

* This project can be used to monitor room temperature for comfort control or to track temperature changes in greenhouses, storage units, or other environments where temperature is a crucial factor.
* By adding features like humidity sensors or alarms, you can create a more comprehensive environmental monitoring system.

**Code Structure:**

The Arduino code for this project involves these key sections:

1. **Library Inclusion:** Include the necessary libraries for I2C communication with the LCD (`LiquidCrystal_I2C.h`) and DHT sensor communication (`DHT.h`).
2. **Pin Definitions:** Define the data pin connected to the DHT11 sensor and the I2C address of the LCD display.
3. **Setup Function:** This function initializes the I2C communication and configures the LCD display size (16 columns, 2 rows).
4. **Main Loop:** This loop continuously executes:
    * Reads temperature data from the DHT11 sensor using the library functions.
    * Formats the temperature value with a chosen unit (째C or 째F).
    * Clears the first line of the LCD display.
    * Displays the formatted temperature data on the first line.
